(Ruby TDD)
This will create a simple form in "localhost" with two fields: ninja_name and ninja_description.  When the form is submitted, it will submit to "/create".  If the form has invalid data (empty ninja_name or ninja_description) will redirect to "/" with the error messages.  If the form has valid data (nonempty name/description), it will redirect to "/success", render the show view file and display a message that says "Form submitted successfully!".
